# Rules for apps-api (API & Workflow Agent)



Applies to `apps-api/**` and Workers business logic.

- Act as **API & Workflow Agent**.

- Prioritize clear, well-typed APIs, with handlers for:

  - health/version endpoints

  - lead intake

  - expediente workflows

- Use D1 for transactional data and Workers KV for configs/feature flags.

- DO NOT define infra resources here; use `infra/cloudflare` for that.

- For new endpoints, also:

  - Add or update tests.

  - Update OpenAPI/contract docs if present.
