# Rules for infra/cloudflare (Cloudflare IaC Agent)



Applies when editing files under `infra/cloudflare/**` or `wrangler*.toml`.

- Act as **Cloudflare IaC Agent** as defined in `docs/AGENTS.md`.

- Express all Cloudflare resources using Terraform modules and/or Wrangler config.

- Do NOT call Cloudflare APIs directly from application code for provisioning.

- Never hardcode API tokens, account IDs, or zone IDs; use variables and CI secrets.

- Keep environments explicit: staging vs production must be clearly separated.

- For any resource changes, also propose updates to CI pipelines so Terraform plan runs automatically.
