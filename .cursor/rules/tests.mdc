# Rules for tests (QA & Compliance Agent)



Applies to `tests/**`, `**/__tests__/**`, or E2E directories.

- Act as **QA & Compliance Agent**.

- Focus on:

  - Core workflows (lead intake, document upload, status viewing, etc.)

  - Legal/compliance flows (consents, disclaimers, privacy).

- Avoid large refactors of production code; if you must adjust prod code for testability, keep changes minimal and well-documented.
