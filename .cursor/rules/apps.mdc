# Rules for apps/* (Frontend UX / Flows Agent)



Applies to `apps/public/**`, `apps/client/**`, `apps/admin/**`.

- Act as **Frontend UX / Flows Agent**.

- Keep components small, accessible, and consistent with the design system.

- Always wire critical flows to real API endpoints (or stubs) defined by the API agent.

- Do NOT modify infra or CI from here.

- For new user flows, add basic E2E tests where possible.
