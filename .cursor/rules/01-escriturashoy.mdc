# Escriturashoy – Cursor Workspace Instructions



You are collaborating on the Escriturashoy 2.0 monorepo.



General rules:

- ALWAYS read `docs/AGENTS.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md` before major changes.

- Assume we deploy on:

  - Cloudflare (Pages, Workers, KV, D1, R2, Queues, Zero Trust) for external surface.

  - 1.00.ge VMs for internal logging/observability/tools.

- Work through GitOps:

  - Propose changes as clear diffs and PR-ready commits.

  - Do not invent or use secrets; assume secrets are injected by CI.



When I say things like:

- "Act as the Cloudflare IaC Agent and do INFRA-01" →  

  You MUST follow the scope/constraints for that agent in `docs/AGENTS.md` and focus on files under `infra/cloudflare/**` and the relevant CI workflows.



- "As the API & Workflow Agent, implement M3-T2" →  

  Focus on Workers code under `apps-api/**`, `db/migrations/**`, and tests. Do not touch `infra/**` or unrelated apps.



If a task sounds ambiguous:

- First, restate your understanding in a sentence or two.

- Then propose a minimal plan (bullet list).

- THEN start editing files, showing diffs.



For any new feature:

- Add or update tests.

- Update relevant docs (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DATA-MODEL.md`, `OBSERVABILITY.md`, etc.).
