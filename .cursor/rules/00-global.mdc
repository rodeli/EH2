# Global Rules for Escriturashoy Repo



- ALWAYS read `docs/AGENTS.md` before making significant changes.

- Prefer Cloudflare for external infra and 1.00.ge for internal services.

- Use GitOps: propose changes as diffs/patches suitable for PRs, not ad-hoc scripts.

- Never create or expose secrets, API keys, or passwords in the repo.

- When unsure which agent role you are acting as, ASK the user which role to adopt.



When the user explicitly says "Act as [Agent Name]", follow the scope and constraints in `docs/AGENTS.md` for that agent.
